3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `server` directory and install its dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd server

    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    In the `server` directory, copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open the `.env` file and fill in the required values (like `JWT_SECRET`).

### Running the Application

You'll need to run the frontend and backend servers in separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    In the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
